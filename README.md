# data_visualization_challenge 

data_visualization_challenge is an exercise to practice ETL methods and to practice using matplotlip to visualize data. 

Pharmaceutical cancer data, sourced from two CSV files from 'Pymaceuticals, Inc' found in the data folder, contains multiple drug trials on mice to determine their effect on tumor size. 

The data was cleaned, organized, and then analyzed to support a report on the clinical study. Summary statistics were generated based on drug regimen and tumor size, Figures were constructed based on drug regimen, sex ratio, and tumor volume.
